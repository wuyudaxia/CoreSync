# CoreSync : Cross-Platform File Synchronization System

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensures seamless file synchronization across Linux, macOS, Windows, and virtual environments.
- **Centralized Management**: A robust server component centralizes data storage, offering a unified view of your files.
- **Optimized Clients**: High-performance clients for Linux and macOS, developed in C/C++, guarantee minimal overhead and fast synchronization.
- **Intuitive Windows Client**: A user-friendly graphical interface for Windows, simplifying the management and synchronization of files.
- **Secure Transmissions**: Utilizes SSL/TLS encrypted sockets for secure data communication between clients and the server.
- **Incremental Sync**: Intelligent synchronization mechanism that only transfers changes, optimizing data transfer and reducing sync times.
- **Adaptive Networking**: Features designed to maintain connectivity across various network configurations, including those with NATs or firewalls.

## Architecture
CoreSync adopts a client-server model with a central server managing data storage and synchronization logic. Clients on supported platforms interact with the server via encrypted channels, syncing files as per user preferences.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Linux-based server for the central storage component.
- Development tools for C/C++ on Linux and macOS platforms.
- .NET Framework or .NET Core SDK for the Windows client development.

### Installation

#### Server Setup
1. Prepare a Linux server with sufficient storage capacity.
2. Install necessary dependencies with your package manager.
3. Deploy the CoreSync server application and configure it according to the provided documentation.

#### Client Installation
- **Linux/macOS**:
  1. Clone the CoreSync repository.
  2. Compile the client using the provided Makefile.
  3. Configure the client to connect to your CoreSync server.

- **Windows**:
  1. Download the latest release from the CoreSync repository.
  2. Execute the installer and follow the installation wizard.
  3. Launch CoreSync and set up your synchronization preferences.

## Usage
Configure your synchronization settings through the client interface, choosing folders to sync, setting synchronization intervals, and customizing other preferences to suit your needs.

## Security
CoreSync prioritizes the security of your data. All communications are encrypted with SSL/TLS, and robust authentication protocols ensure that only authorized devices can access the synchronization service.
